## 15+: Passing exams and other achievements

ChatGPT has passed a number of university or professional admission tests (this can also tell you something about the tests).

The system can typically answer questions that require reasoning and knowledge of the world (even in depth)—it cannot manipulate physical entities, interpret images or solve maths problems beyond simple arithmetics. Again, what is exciting for me is the incredible bandwidth of the system. There are probably only a few human beings who can directly pass medical, legal and business exams at this level.

At the moment, however, ChatGPT mostly just passed, the grades weren’t insanely great.
