## 50+: Jailbreaking

Jailbreaking, aka prompt injection, is a method of getting ChatGPT to write something that violates OpenAI’s policies, such as insulting minorities, posting instructions for a Molotov cocktail, or making a plan for world domination of AIs.

OpenAI tries to make its model better, more abuse-proof, more politically correct (maybe even woker) practically every day. Typically, many jailbreaks do not work for very long.

But with help of a jailbreaking prompt we bring ChatGPT to say nasty things.
