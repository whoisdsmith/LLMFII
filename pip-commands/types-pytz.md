## Typing Stubs for Pytz

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pytz`](https://github.com/stub42/pytz) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pytz`.

This version of `types-pytz` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pytz==2024.1`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pytz. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7d56cd9a6cf6e0a4ea89c68d0397e197aff32cbe` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.358, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
