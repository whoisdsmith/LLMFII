Bit of a different video this time, but I've been having a lot of fun with AI-generated imagery lately, so I figured I'd show some people how to get around the "too much traffic" popup from the dall-e mini demo.

#### Amazing AI
- Description: Generate images from text using Stable Diffusion 1.5. Simply describe the image you desire, and the app will generate it for you like magic!

Developed exclusively for Apple silicon (M1/M2) - The app is NOT compatible with devices running on Intel chips.

The app runs offline on your computer and also includes support for Shortcuts.


■ Recommended System Requirements

16 GB of RAM


■ FAQ

‣ Why not use Stable Diffusion 2?

It will eventually be supported, but right now, it's worse than 1.5.

‣ Why does the app take up so much space on disk and memory?

The AI model used to generate images is large.

‣ Can you support inpainting?

I don't plan to support this.

#### Learnable latent embeddings for joint behavioural and neural analysis
- Description: Mapping behavioural actions to neural activity is a fundamental goal of neuroscience. As our ability to record large neural and behavioural data increases, there is growing interest in modeling neural dynamics during adaptive behaviors to probe neural representations. In particular, neural latent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behavior, yet, we lack non-linear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behavior and neural data. Here, we fill this gap with a novel method, CEBRA, that jointly uses behavioural and neural data in a hypothesis- or discovery-driven manner to produce consistent, high-performance latent spaces. We validate its accuracy and demonstrate our tool's utility for both calcium and electrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks, and in simple or complex behaviors across species. It allows for single and multi-session datasets to be leveraged for hypothesis testing or can be used label-free. Lastly, we show that CEBRA can be used for the mapping of space, uncovering complex kinematic features, and rapid, high-accuracy decoding of natural movies from visual cortex.
