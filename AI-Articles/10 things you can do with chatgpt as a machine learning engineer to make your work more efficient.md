# 10 things you can do with ChatGPT as a Machine Learning Engineer to make your work more efficient.

## How to get your work faster and more efficiently with the help of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT

# A few lines about GPT3.5 and ChatGPT

A couple of days ago Elon Musk-Sam Altman backed OpenAI (founded 2015) released its latest release of the GPT LLM ‚Äî now called **GPT3.5** and along with it ChatGPT ( or sometimes called GPTChat ) .

GPT3.5 is trained on ‚Äò*a blend of text and code*‚Äô published prior to Q4 2021. It is the predecessor to the **much anticipated GPT4** ( which will probably be released later in 2023 and the promised model will have around 100 trillion parameters !!! ( a six times increase from the current models )

To test out the demo version of GPTChat ‚Äî [head to this link .](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

Here‚Äôs a quick look at the GPT3.5 models involved to appreciate the interactions and training methods.

# How can the ChatGPT be useful for the machine learning engineer /Data Scientist ?

We tried a few things with ChatGPT and these were some of the good use-cases we thought were useful. (some were hits , some were misses ‚Ä¶ try what works for you ! )

Here are 10 things you can, as a Data Scientist / ML engineer do with ChatGPT.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Explain Machine Learning algorithms in simple words

In case you want a quick recap of what an algorithm does/how it works, ask ChatGPT to do it for you.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Help you debug some complex error messages in your machine learning code .

Remember those times when you used to have trouble understanding what an error message means, only to head over to `**stackoverflow**` to find even more obscure explanations ? Not anymore.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get a starter code generated for simple tasks/ functions ( And also code completion / autocompletion )

We didn't stop at simple tasks and functions ‚Äî but wanted to see if we can make it write an ML code for building an **image classifier using PyTorch** on the MNIST dataset .

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Refactor your code.

Make some good looking code by just pasting it in the chat box and ask the AI to do it for you!

üëâ **Word of caution** : Make sure you test the results from the generated code)
