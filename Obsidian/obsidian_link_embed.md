# Obsidian Link Embed

This plugin allows you to convert URLs in your notes into embedded previews.

This is how it looks.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seraphli/obsidian-link-embed/main/docs/demo.gif)

**Note** Starting from 2.0.0, embeds are rendered with `MarkdownCodeBlockProcessor`, which avoids expanding the HTML block. You can convert your old embeds to new code blocks with the `Convert` button in the setting.

PS: If you happen to know any other website that provides free API for users to grab metadata from URLs, please let me know. This plugin can be more robust with your help.

## Usage

The easiest way to use is by pasting your link and then creating an embed preview.

Additionally, there are three ways to pass the URL to this plugin.

1. Selecting the URL you want to parse

If nothing is selected

2. Put your cursor within the URL text that you want to parse

Or

3. Copy the URL into the clipboard

Then

- Open the command Palette
- Select the command `Link Embed: Embed link`

In case some parsers are not working, you can also use the `Link Embed: Embed link with ...` to specify one parser.

### Settings

If you enable `Auto Embed` in the setting, the plugin will automatically replace the link with an embed preview when you paste the link into an empty line. Although this option is quite convenient, I set the default setting to false in case someone doesn't know what happened.

You can change the default parser in the plugin settings.

And `In Place` means the selection in the editor will be removed.

The embedded preview will always be inserted into the next line.

Here is the table comparing the supported parsers.

| Parser                                      | Speed  | Stable | Desc Length | Limitation |
