## Requirements

If you want to interact with self-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), you will need to have the self-hosted API set up and running. You can follow the instructions provided by the self-hosted API provider to get it up and running. Once you have the REST API URL for your self-hosted API, you can use it with this plugin to interact with your models.

Access to other models may require an API key.

Please see [instructions](https://github.com/longy2k/obsidian-bmo-chatbot/wiki) to setup with other LLMs providers.

Explore some models at [GPT4ALL](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) under the "Model Explorer" section or [Ollama's Library](https://ollama.ai/library).
