#Indexator

This plugin is supposed to help you clean up messy repositories by introducing a new and unique file structure, by using tags

The basic filestructure is  folder-> Index  & folder(indexed) -> all Files.

Files are being indexed by using tags, if a file contains multiple tags it will be indexed multiple times - the tags will be sorted either alphabetically or chronoligacally.
