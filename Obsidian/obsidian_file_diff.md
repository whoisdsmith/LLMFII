## Commands

`Compare`: Compare your active file with another file and look at the differences.

`Compare and merge`: Same as `Compare`, but you have the option to merge changes.

`Find sync conflicts and merge`: Finds all Syncthing conflicts and shows the merge option for each conflict sequentially.
