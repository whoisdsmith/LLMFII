# Logstravaganza

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that logs all console output and uncaught exceptions to a note in a vault.  **It's mainly aimed at developers.**

As such, it's also useful for letting your plugin's users help you debug your plugin's issues: Ask your customers to install this plugin, then send you the resulting log when they report a bug.


## What it does

- Intercepts and writes all `console.*()` output to a file in your vault.
- Logs uncaught exceptions to the same file, including exceptions occurring in async code and promises (as long as they're happening in the main thread).
- Logs can be written in several formats:
    - [NDJSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec), a plain text format that can be read by humans and machines alike. Every line in the file is a JSON object. Think CSV, but with JSON.
    - Markdown file containing a table.
    - Markdown file containing code blocks.


## Example output

The log output will be written to a `console-log.DEVICE-NAME.*` or, optionally, `console-log.DEVICE-NAME.2024-01-31.*` . (Here, `DEVICE-NAME` is a placeholder for the actual device name as returned by the core Sync plugin. This works whether or not Sync is activated or not.)


### Using the NDJSON formatter

Output file name: `console-log.DEVICE-NAME.ndjson`

Obsidian won't open `.ndjson` files, even though they're basically plain text files.

In NDJSON, every line is a self-contained JSON object.  This makes it easy to read and parse with tools like `jq`. For example, the file can be filtered with `jq`:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.level == "error")' < "console-log.DEVICE-NAME.ndjson"
```

This will only show the lines where the `level` is `error`. You can also stream the output of the plugin to a file and then use `jq` to filter it in real-time.

```bash
tail -f "console-log.DEVICE-NAME.ndjson" | jq -r 'select(.level == "error")'
```

In reading mode, the output will be displayed as separate MD code blocks.

## Caveats

Naturally, the plugin can't know about past console output.  It can only log what happens after when it's activated/enabled.

**Please note:** When this plugin is active and proxying `console` calls, all output to the actual console will appear as coming from `plugin:logstravaganza`.
