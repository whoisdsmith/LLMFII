# tinyfeed 

![banner](banner.svg)

**tinyfeed** is a CLI tool that generate a static HTML page from a collection of feeds.

You can effortlessly set it up in crond or systemd and direct your HTTP server 
to the generated `index.html` and voilà, you’ve got yourself a webpage 
that aggregate your feeds.

## Feature

- RSS, Atom and JSON feeds are all supported thanks to the awesome 
[gofeed library](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed)
- Highly customizable, especially with the ability to use external stylesheet and templates.
- Dark / Light theme based on system preference
- Generated page is lightweight and fully accessible
- Summaries of the articles are available by clinking on the side


## Usage

The CLI app is design to work with basic pipelining and stdout redirections. 

```
Usage:
  tinyfeed [FEED_URL ...] [flags]

Examples:
  single feed      tinyfeed lovergne.dev/rss.xml > index.html
  multiple feeds   cat feeds.txt | tinyfeed > index.html

Flags:
  -i, --images               Add this flag to load images in summaries
  -d, --description string   Add a description after the name of your page
  -h, --help                 help for tinyfeed
  -l, --limit int            How many articles will be included (default 50)
  -n, --name string          Title of the page. (default "Feed")
  -q, --quiet                Add this flag to silence warnings.
  -s, --stylesheet string    Path to an external CSS stylesheet
  -t, --template string      Path to a custom HTML+Go template file.
      --timeout int          timeout to get feeds in seconds (default 15)
```

⚠️ When using a redirection directly, like in the example, your HTML page will be
blank while tinyfeed is processing. it will also stay blank if there is an error.
 To avoid that, use a tempory file: 

```bash
cat feeds | tinyfeed > /tpm/tinyfeed && mv tinyfeed /path/to/index.html
```

## Installation

### Install from binary 

You can download the official binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed/releases/latest/). Currently only arm64 architecure on Linux, Mqx and Windows, is
supported. If you need something else than that, please open an issue and I will
add it to the releases process.

Here is a quick example of how to install the binary for linux:

```bash
wget https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed/releases/latest/download/tinyfeed_linux_arm64
chmod +x tinyfeed_linux_arm64
sudo mv tinyfeed_linux_arm64 /usr/local/bin/tinyfeed
tinyfeed --help
```

If you are on Alpine you also need to install [gcompat](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/gcompat) to fix the usual musl / glibc compatibility
issues.

```bash
apk add gcompat
```

### Install with Go

```bash 
go install github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed@latest
```

## External HTML+Go template 

You can provide you own template for page generation. For an exemple template
check out the [built-in one](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed/blob/main/built-in).
To learn about HTML+Go template check the [official documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template). 

Inside you template you will have access to data with the following struct and functions:

```go
type data struct {
    Metadata map[string]string
    Items    []*gofeed.Item
    Feeds    []*gofeed.Feed
}

func preview(item *gofeed.Item) string

func domain(item *gofeed.Item) string
```
