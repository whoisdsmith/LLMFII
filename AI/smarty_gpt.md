# Smarty-GPT
## A wrapper of LLMs (chatgpt, gpt4, etc.) that biases its behaviour using prompts

</p>

A wrapper of LLMs that biases its behaviour using prompts and contexts in a **transparent** manner to the end-users.

## Installation 

```bash
sh install.sh
```

## Models

- **text-davinci-003**
- [**Flan-T5**](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small) powered by Google.
- **ChatGPT** and **GPT4** through paid API.

## Contexts / Prompts

We support three type of prompts from the moment:

- **Manual prompts**: these prompts are hard-coded and were the first included in this project.
- [**Awesome Chat GPT prompts**](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts): our system also supports this huge HF dataset in a transparent manner.
- **Custom prompts**: any user can add custom prompts through a file.
- (In progress) Support for [**awesome-gpt4**](https://github.com/radi-cho/awesome-gpt4) prompts.


## Authentication

Users should create a *config.txt* file like the following to read Open AI bearer:

```txt
[auth]
api_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Coding examples

```python
from smartygpt import SmartyGPT, Models
if __name__=="__main__":
    s = SmartyGPT(prompt="DoctorAdvice", config_file="/home/user/config.txt") 
    result = s.wrapper("Can Vitamin D cure COVID-19?")
    print(result)
```

## Philosophy

The main purpose of this project is **joining** in a single environment all the resources (models, prompts, APIs, etc.) related to LLMs. 

Moreover, we also think from an **end-user** perspective. It is heavily unlikely that a user would introduce a complex context in a query to bias a model response. This library tries to solve this hidding the implementation details to end-users.

## In progress

More features/models are about to come! Feel free to make a PR, open an issue or to contact me at marcosfernandez.pichel@usc.es
