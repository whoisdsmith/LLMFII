# Changelog

## 🔥Auto-Lyrics version #5 - WORKING AS OF APRIL 20th 2023🔥

In v5, we have successfully integrated a functional webapp, combining the power of yt-dlp (youtube-downloader) and whisper-cTranslate2 (faster-whisper) for an enhanced user experience. 🎶💻

### Auto-Lyrics version #4 - PREPARING FOR A SECURE FUTURE 👀

In v4, we proposed the concept of employing a very simple SHA hashing algorithm to securely encode and compress lyrics. This would save space on ChatGPT-4 and maintain privacy. Although not implemented in v4 or v5, this idea will be revisited if necessary in the future. 🔒

🛠️ Bug fixes: We'll address all reported bugs from v2 to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience.
