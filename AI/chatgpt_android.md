## üíª How to build the project?

For proper project setup, it's essential to follow the instructions below. In most cases, you can complete all configuration steps within 10 to 20 minutes:

1. Go to the __[Stream login page](https://getstream.io/try-for-free?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_April2024_Jaewoong_ChatGPT&utm_term=DevRelOss)__.

2. If you have your GitHub or Google account, click the **Continue with GitHub** or **Continue with Google** button and you can sign up within a couple of seconds. 

![stream](figures/stream0.png)

3. Go to the __[Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_April2024_Jaewoong_ChatGPT&utm_term=DevRelOss)__ and click the **Create App** button like the below.

![stream](figures/stream1.png)

4. Fill in the blanks like the below and click the **Create App** button.

![stream](figures/stream2.png)

5. You will see the **Key** like the figure below and then copy it.

![stream](figures/stream3.png)

6. Create a new file named **secrets.properties** on the root directory of this Android project, and add the key to the `secrets.properties` file like the below:

![stream](https://github.com/skydoves/gemini-android/blob/main/figures/stream5.png)

```gradle
STREAM_API_KEY=..
```

7. Go to your __[Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Jaewoong_OSS&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=Github_April2024_Jaewoong_ChatGPT&utm_term=DevRelOss)__ again and click your App.

9. In the **Overview** menu, you can find the **Authentication** category by scrolling to the middle of the page.
10. Switch on the **Disable Auth Checks** option and click the **Submit** button like the figure below.

![stream](figures/stream4.png)

11. Click the **Explorer** tab on the left side menu.

12. Click **users** -> **Create New User** button sequentially and add fill in the user like the below:

![stream](figures/stream6.png)

- User Name: `Chat GPT`
- User ID: `70ef052a-da88-4451-af92-99f7ed335a71`

13. Now, it's time to set up the OpenAI API key. Go to __[OpenAI API Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)__, login with your Google account and click **Start verification** to verify your phone number to create an API key.

![stream](figures/stream7.png)

14. After verifying your phone number, click the **Create new secret key** on the page like the image below and create your API key:

![stream](figures/stream8.png)

15. Copy and paste your API key to the `secrets.properties` file as named `GPT_API_KEY` under the `STREAM_API_KEY` field:

![stream](figures/stream9.png)

```gradle
GPT_API_KEY=..
```

16. Unlock Rate limits for OpenAI APIs

As per the guidelines outlined in their [Rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) documentation, access to the free tier of the API is __granted after a minimum expenditure of $5 since the creation of your account__. That means, you should register your payment method to the OpenAI and purchase initial credits. 

![stream](figures/stream10.png)

So you should go to the [OpenAI Billings](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview) and click the **Add payment details** button like the image below:

![stream](figures/stream11.png)

17. Once you've added your payment deatils, you'll able to see the **Add to creadit balance** button like the image below:

![stream](figures/stream12.png)

Next, click the **Add to credit balance** button to purchase the initial credit. As you've discovered in the previous step, the minimum credit starts from $5. Therefore, if you only intend to utilize the API limits for testing or building a side project, you can opt for the minimum pricing. Also, not that it's advisable to disable the automatic recharge option to avoid unexpected charges.

![stream](figures/stream13.png)

18. Once you've completed all those steps above, now build, run and enjoy your the project!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

You can typically find the reasons behind your error code by referring to the [OpenAI Error code documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes).

### 401 Error

If you encounter 401 errors while chatting with ChatGPT app, as shown in the image below, it's crucial to verify the correctness of your OpenAI API key. Ensure that there are no typos in your API key and that it has been correctly copied and pasted into the `secrets.properties` file, as outlined in the guidelines above.

![stream](figures/stream14.png)

### 429 Error

If you encounter this error from the outset, it's likely that your rate limits do not meet the requirements. Please revisit step 16 in the guidelines above for further instructions.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

**ChatGPT Android** follows the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

![architecture](figures/figure0.png)

**ChatGPT Android** was built with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.<br>

The overall architecture is composed of two layers; UI Layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they each have different responsibilities.
The arrow means the component has a dependency on the target component following its direction.

### Architecture Overview

![layer](figures/figure1.png)

Each layer has different responsibilities below. Basically, they follow [unidirectional event/data flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf).

### UI Layer

![layer](figures/figure2.png)

The UI Layer consists of UI elements like buttons, menus, tabs that could interact with users and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes.

### Data Layer

![layer](figures/figure3.png)

The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database and requesting remote data from the network. It is implemented as an offline-first source of business logic and follows the [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) principle.<br>

For more information about the overall architecture, check out **[Build a Real-Time WhatsApp Clone With Jetpack Compose](https://getstream.io/blog/build-whatsapp-clone/)**.

## Modularization

![modules](figures/figure4.png)

**ChatGPT Android** adopted modularization strategies below:

- **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time.

- **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time.

- **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules.
