- You want to increase customization (e.g. use your own models, extend the API, etc.)
- You work in a data-sensitive environment (healthcare, IoT, military, law, etc.)
- Your product does have poor or no internet access (military, IoT, edge, extreme environment, etc.)
- (not our main focus) You operate on a large scale and want to reduce your costs
- (not our main focus) You operate on a large scale and want to increase your speed

# ü§ñ Our definition of Software 3.0

First, our definition of **Software 3.0**, as it is a loaded term:
Software 3.0 is the bridge connecting the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models with the practical needs of human digital activity. It is a comprehensive approach that allows LLMs to:
1. perform the same activity (or better) on the digital world than humans
2. generally, allow the user to [perform more operations without conscious effort](https://third.software/)

# üìè Principles

HAL-9100 is in continuous development, with the aim of always offering better infrastructure for **Edge Software 3.0**. To achieve this, it is based on several principles that define its functionality and scope.

<details>
<summary><strong>Less prompt is more</strong></summary>
<p>

As few prompts as possible should be hard-coded into the infrastructure, just enough to bridge the gap between **Software 1.0** and **Software 3.0** and give the client as much control as possible on the prompts.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Edge-first</strong></summary>
<p>

HAL-9100 does not require internet access by focusing on **open source LLMs**. Which means you own your data and your models. It runs on a Raspberry PI (LLM included).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OpenAI-compatible</strong></summary>
<p>

OpenAI spent a large amount of the best brain power to design this API, which makes it an incredible experience for developers. Support for OpenAI LLMs are not a priority at all though.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Reliable and deterministic</strong></summary>
<p>

HAL-9100 focus on reliability and being as deterministic as possible by default. That's why everything has to be tested and benchmarked.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Flexible</strong></summary>
<p>

A minimal number of hard-coded prompts and behaviors, a wide range of models, infrastructure components and deployment options and it play well with the open-source ecosystem, while only integrating projects that have stood the test of time.

</p>
</details>

# Quickstart

Get started in less than a minute through GitHub Codespaces:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/llm-edge/hal-9100?quickstart=1)

Or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llm-edge/hal-9100
cd hal-9100
```

To get started quickly, let's use Anyscale API.
Get an API key from Anyscale. You can get it [here](https://app.endpoints.anyscale.com/credentials). Replace in [hal-9100.toml](./hal-9100.toml) the `model_api_key` with your API key.

<details>
<summary>Usage w/ ollama</summary>
<p>

1. use `model_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions"`
2. set `gemma:2b` in [examples/quickstart.js](./examples/quickstart.js)
3. and run `ollama run gemma:2b & && docker compose --profile api -f docker/docker-compose.yml up`

</p>
</details>


Install OpenAI SDK: `npm i openai`

Start the infra:

```bash
docker compose --profile api -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

Run the [quickstart](./examples/quickstart.js):

```bash
node examples/quickstart.js
```

# ü§î FAQ

<details>
<summary>Is there a hosted version?</summary>

No. HAL-9100 is not a hosted service. It's a software that you can deploy on your infrastructure. We can help you deploy it on your infrastructure. [Contact us](https://cal.com/louis030195/applied-ai).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which LLM API can I use?</summary>


Examples of LLM APIs that does support OpenAI API-like, that you can use:
- ollama
- [MLC-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm)
- [FastChat (good if you have a mac)](https://github.com/llm-edge/hal-9100/tree/main/examples/hello-world-mistral-curl)
- [vLLM (good if you have a modern gpu)](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#openai-compatible-server)
- [Perplexity API](https://github.com/llm-edge/hal-9100/tree/main/examples/hello-world-code-interpreter-mixtral-nodejs)
- Mistral API
- anyscale
- together ai

We recommend these models:
- mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1
- mistralai/mistral-7b

Other models have not been extensively tested and may not work as expected, but you can try them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference with LangChain?</summary>
1. LangChain spans proprietary LLM and open source, among the thousands of things it spans. HAL-9100 laser focuses on Software 3.0 for the edge. 


2. You can write AI products in 50 lines of code instead of 5000 and having to learn a whole new abstraction
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are you related to OpenAI?</summary>
No.
</details>

<details>
<summary>I don't use Assistants API. Can I use this?</summary>
We recommend switching to the Assistants API for a more streamlined experience, allowing you to focus more on your product than on infrastructure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does the Assistants API support audio and images?</summary>
Images soon, working on it.
</details>
