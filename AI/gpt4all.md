## About GPT4All

GPT4All is an ecosystem to run **powerful** and **customized** large language models that work locally on consumer grade CPUs and NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Note that your CPU needs to support [AVX instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions).

Learn more in the [documentation](https://docs.gpt4all.io).

A GPT4All model is a 3GB - 8GB file that you can download and plug into the GPT4All software. **Nomic AI** supports and maintains this software ecosystem to enforce quality and security alongside spearheading the effort to allow any person or enterprise to easily deploy their own on-edge large language models.


### Installation

The recommended way to install GPT4All is to use one of the online installers linked above in this README, which are also available at the [GPT4All website](https://gpt4all.io/). These require an internet connection at install time, are slightly easier to use on macOS due to code signing, and provide a version of GPT4All that can check for updates.

An alternative way to install GPT4All is to use one of the offline installers available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/releases). These do not require an internet connection at install time, and can be used to install an older version of GPT4All if so desired. But using these requires acknowledging a security warning on macOS, and they provide a version of GPT4All that is unable to notify you of updates, so you should enable notifications for Releases on this repository (Watch > Custom > Releases) or sign up for announcements in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mGZE39AS3e).


### What's New
- **October 19th, 2023**: GGUF Support Launches with Support for:
    - Mistral 7b base model, an updated model gallery on [gpt4all.io](https://gpt4all.io), several new local code models including Rift Coder v1.5
    - [Nomic Vulkan](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/gpt4all-gpu-inference-with-vulkan) support for Q4\_0 and Q4\_1 quantizations in GGUF.
    - Offline build support for running old versions of the GPT4All Local LLM Chat Client.
- **September 18th, 2023**: [Nomic Vulkan](https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/gpt4all-gpu-inference-with-vulkan) launches supporting local LLM inference on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
- **July 2023**: Stable support for LocalDocs, a feature that allows you to privately and locally chat with your data.
- **June 28th, 2023**: [Docker-based API server] launches allowing inference of local LLMs from an OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint.

[Docker-based API server]: https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/tree/cef74c2be20f5b697055d5b8b506861c7b997fab/gpt4all-api
