# Aeona Project

## Creating a new era of discord bots

### By Aeonic Developement

<a href="https://aeonabot.xyz/support"><img src="https://aeonabot.xyz/logo.webp"></a>

For Discord, Aeona wants to be a multifunctional all-in-one chatbot.
Slash commands will usher in a new era for Discord, but we must not lose sight of our legacy with message commands.
Aeona supports slash-based commands as well as message-based commands.

- The ability to support the greatest number of languages.
- A simple and intuitive codebase.
- Every aspect is customizable.
- The most recent version of Discordenoas soon as possible.

## Features/Goals

PS: Check back often for new updates to this list.

- Support for multiple languages.
- Using menus and buttons for selection.
- AntiNuke, Welcomer, Logging, Boost Logging, Server Stats, and more are all features of the AI chatbot.
- Strong automated security features, such as anti-nuke, anti-spam, anti-scam, anti-mass-mention, and many others.
- A lot of fun commands and minigames (more than 200).
- A levelling and advanced economy system.
- An easy-to-use dashboard.
