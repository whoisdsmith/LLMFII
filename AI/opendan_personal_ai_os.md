OpenDAN is an open source Personal AI OS , which consolidates various AI modules in one place for your personal use.

## **Project Introduction**

OpenDAN (Open and Do Anything Now with AI) is revolutionizing the AI landscape with its Personal AI Operating System. Designed for seamless integration of diverse AI modules, it ensures unmatched interoperability. OpenDAN empowers users to craft powerful AI agents—from butlers and assistants to personal tutors and digital companions—all while retaining control. These agents can team up to tackle complex challenges, integrate with existing services, and command smart(IoT) devices.

With OpenDAN, we're putting AI in your hands, making life simpler and smarter.

This project is still in its very early stages, and there may be significant changes in the future.

## **Updates**

After over three months of development, the code for the first version of OpenDAN MVP (0.5.1), driven by the new contributor `waterflier`, has been merged into the Master branch. This version has realized many concepts proposed in the PoC version of OpenDAN and completed the basic framework of the OS, especially defining the application form on AIOS. Currently, the 0.5.1 version operates in an "all-in-one" mode. For 0.5.2, we will advance the formal implementation of the OpenDAN OS kernel based on the partial framework code of the [CYFS Owner Online Device(OOD) OS](https://github.com/buckyos/CYFS) that has already been completed.

## **Installation**

There are two ways to install the Internal Test Version of OpenDAN:

1. Installation through docker, this is also the installation method we recommend now
2. Installing through the source code, this method may encounter some traditional Python dependence problems and requires you to have a certain ability to solve.But if you want to do secondary development of OpenDAN, this method is necessary.

### Preparation before installation

1. Docker environment
This article does not introduce how to install the docker, execute it under your console

```
docker -version
```

If you can see the docker version number (> 20.0), it means that you have installed Docker.
If you don't know how to install docker, you can refer to [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. OpenAI API Token
If there is no api token, you can apply for [here](https://beta.openai.com/)

Applying for the API Token may have some thresholds for new players. You can find friends around you, and he can give you a temporary, or join our internal test experience group. We will also release some free experience API token from time to time.These token is limited to the maximum consumption and effective time

### Install

After executing the following command, you can install the Docker Image of OpenDAN

```
docker pull paios/aios:latest
```

## **Run OpenDAN**

The first Run of OpenDAN needs to be initialized. You need to enter some information in the process of initialization. Therefore, when starting the docker, remember to bring the -it parameter.

OpenDAN is your Personal AIOS, so it will generate some important personal data (such as chat history with agent, schedule data, etc.) during its operation. These data will be stored on your local disk. ThereforeWe recommend that you mount the local disk into the container of Docker so that the data can be guaranteed.

```
docker run -v /your/local/myai/:/root/myai --name aios -it paios/aios:latest 
```

In the above command, we also set up a Docker instance for Docker Run named AIOS, which is convenient for subsequent operations.You can also use your favorite name instead.

After the first operation of the docker instance is created, it only needs to be executed again:

```
docker start -ai aios
```

If you plan to run in a service mode (NO UI), you don't need to bring the -AI parameter:

```
docker start aios
```

### Hello, Jarvis

After the configuration is completed, you will enter a AIOS Shell, which is similar to Linux Bash and similar. The meaning of this interface is:
The current user "username" is communicating with the name "Agent/Workflow of Jarvis". The current topic is default.

Say Hello to your private AI assistant Jarvis !

**If everything is OK, you will get a reply from Jarvis after a moment .At this time, the OpenDAN system is running .**

## **Core Concepts and Features of OpenDAN**
1. **AI Agent**: Driven by a large language model, having own memory.The AI Agent completes tasks through natural language interaction.
2. **AI Workflow**: Organize different AI Agents into an AI Agent Group to complete complex tasks.
![workflow](./doc/res/workflow.png)
3. **AI Environment**: Supports AI Agents to access file systems, IoT devices, network services, smart contracts, and everything on today's internet once authorized.
4. **AI Marketplace**: Offer a solution for one-click installation and use of various AI applications, helping users easily access and manage AI apps.
5. **AI Model Solution**: Provide a unified entry point for model search, download, and access control, making it convenient for users to find and use models suitable for their needs.
6. **Hardware-specific optimization**: Optimize for specific hardware to enable smooth local running of most open-source AI applications.
7. **Strict Privacy Protection and Management**: Strictly manage personal data, ranging from family albums to chat records and social media records, and provide a unified access control interface for AI applications.
8. **Personal knowledge Base**:
9. **Integrated AIGC Workflow**: Offer AIGC Agent/Workflow for users to train their own voice models, Lora models, knowledge models, etc., using personal data. Based on these private model data, integrate the most advanced AIGC algorithm to help people release creativity easily and build more COOL and more personalized content.
10. **Development Framework**: Provide a development framework for customizing AI assistants for specific purposes, making it easy for developers to create unique AI applications / service for their customers.

## **Deeply Understanding OpenDAN**

### Build OpenDAN from source code
1. Install the latest version of python (>= 3.11) and pip
1. Clone the source code
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fiatrete/OpenDAN-Personal-AI-OS.git
   cd OpenDAN-Personal-AI-OS
   ```
1. Enable virtual env
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   ```
1. Install the dependent python library
   ```
   pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt
   ```
   Waiting for installation.
1. Start OpenDAN through aios_shell
   ```
   python ./src/srvice/aios_shell/aios_shell.py
   ```
   1. If seeing error saying `No ffmpeg exe could be found`, you need to install it manually from https://www.ffmpeg.org/
      
Now OpenDAN runs in the development mode, and the directory is:
- AIOS_ROOT: ./rootfs (/opt/aios in docker)
- AIOS_MYAI: ~/myai (/root/myai in docer)
