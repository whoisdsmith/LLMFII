# heyCLI

LLM powered command line. Uses GPT-3 davinci-003 as of last update. It works for Linux and MacOS only for now.

This tool Helps you use command line Terminal without need to remember commands or spend time searching Google and stackoverflow. See the demo below.

## how to install

1. Go to your terminal and download the sh file from this repo 

```
wget -q heycli_client.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyCLI/heyCLI/main/heycli_client.sh -O ~/.heycli_client.sh
```

2. Source the script, type in your terminal:  

```
source ~/.heycli_client.sh
```

3. Go grab an API token here: https://signup.heycli.com/

4. Finally, set the HEYCLI_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal: 

```
export HEYCLI_API_KEY=<token_you_got_in_step_3>
```
5. (Optional) setup context for HeyCLI for improved answers and suggestions. Type:

```
hey setup
```

That's it, you should be able to use the "hey" command!

## IMPORTANT 
The setup command will upload your command history as is. We will add tooling to anonymise and clean the history from potential sensitive data in the future

## Demo & use cases

In addition to simple command suggestions, you can do:

1.  In-terminal debugging of python, nodejs, kubectl, gcloud, aws and many other command errors. When you get an error, just type: hey debug the error above (or something like that, be creative!) 

Example:

To activate this feature, you need to update your heycli_client.sh file. Get the new one from https://github.com/HeyCLI/heyCLI_client

To add a specific command to be debugged, all you need to do is add the command at the end of the heycli_client.sh file (don't forget to source it afterwards!):

2. we attached HeyCLI to some commands so you can type "yes" to execute them. 

Example:
