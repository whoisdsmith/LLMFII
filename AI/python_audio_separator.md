Summary: Easy to use audio stem separation from the command line or as a dependency in your own Python project, using the amazing MDX-Net, VR Arch, Demucs and MDXC models available in UVR by @Anjok07 & @aufr33.

Audio Separator is a Python package that allows you to separate an audio file into various stems, using models trained by @Anjok07 for use with UVR (https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui).

The simplest (and probably most utilized) use case for this package is to separate an audio file into two stems, Instrumental and Vocals which can be very useful for producing Karaoke videos! However, the models available in UVR can separate audio into many more stems, such as Drums, Bass, Piano, Guitar, and perform other audio processing tasks such as denoising and removing echo / reverb.

## Features

- Separate audio into multiple stems, e.g. instrumental and vocals.
- Supports all common audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.)
- Ability to inference using a pre-trained model in PTH or ONNX format.
- CLI support for easy use in scripts and batch processing.
- Python API for integration into other projects.

## Installation 🛠️

### 🐳 Docker

If you're able to use docker, you don't actually need to _install_ anything - there are [images published on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beveradb/audio-separator/tags) for GPU (CUDA) and CPU inferencing, for both `amd64` and `arm64` platforms.

You probably want to volume-mount a folder containing whatever file you want to separate, which can then also be used as the output folder.

For instance, if your current directory has the file `input.wav`, you could execute `audio-separator` as shown below (see [usage](#usage-) section for more details):

```
docker run -it -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator input.wav
```

If you're using a machine with a GPU, you'll want to use the GPU specific image and pass in the GPU device to the container, like this:

```
docker run -it --gpus all -v `pwd`:/workdir beveradb/audio-separator:gpu input.wav
```

If the GPU isn't being detected, make sure your docker runtime environment is passing through the GPU correctly - there are [various guides](https://www.celantur.com/blog/run-cuda-in-docker-on-linux/) online to help with that.


### 🎮 Nvidia GPU with CUDA or 🧪 Google Colab

**Supported CUDA Versions:** 11.8 and 12.2

💬 If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running `audio-separator --env_info`:
 `ONNXruntime has CUDAExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Conda: `conda install pytorch=*=*cuda* onnxruntime=*=*cuda* audio-separator -c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[gpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator:gpu`

###  Apple Silicon, macOS Sonoma+ with M1 or newer CPU (CoreML acceleration)

💬 If successfully configured, you should see this log message when running `audio-separator --env_info`:
 `ONNXruntime has CoreMLExecutionProvider available, enabling acceleration`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[cpu]"`

### 🐢 No hardware acceleration, CPU only:

Conda: `conda install audio-separator-c pytorch -c conda-forge`

Pip: `pip install "audio-separator[cpu]"`

Docker: `beveradb/audio-separator`


### 🎥 FFmpeg dependency

💬 If successfully configured, you should see a `FFmpeg installed` log message when running `audio-separator --env_info`

If you installed `audio-separator` using `conda` or `docker`, FFmpeg should already be avaialble in your environment.

If not, you'll separately need to ensure you have `ffmpeg` installed.
This should be easy to install on most platforms, e.g.:

🐧 Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get update; apt-get install -y ffmpeg`

 macOS:`brew update; brew install ffmpeg`


## GPU / CUDA specific installation steps with Pip

In theory, all you should need to do to get `audio-separator` working with a GPU is install it with the `[gpu]` extra as above.

However, sometimes getting both PyTorch and ONNX Runtime working with CUDA support can be a bit tricky so it may not work that easily.

You may need to reinstall both packages directly, allowing pip to calculate the right versions for your platform, for example:

- `pip uninstall torch onnxruntime`
- `pip cache purge`
- `pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio`
- `pip install --force-reinstall onnxruntime-gpu`

I generally recommend installing the latest version of PyTorch for your environment using the command recommended by the wizard here:
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

### Multiple CUDA library versions may be needed 
Depending on your CUDA version and environment, you may need to install specific version(s) of CUDA libraries for ONNX Runtime to use your GPU.

🧪 Google Colab, for example, now uses CUDA 12 by default, but ONNX Runtime still needs CUDA 11 libraries to work.

If you see the error `Failed to load library` or `cannot open shared object file` when you run `audio-separator`, this is likely the issue.

You can install the CUDA 11 libraries _alongside_ CUDA 12 like so:
- `apt update; apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`

> Note: if anyone knows how to make this cleaner so we can support both different platform-specific dependencies for hardware acceleration without a separate installation process for each, please let me know or raise a PR!


## Usage 🚀

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

You can use Audio Separator via the command line, for example:

```
audio-separator /path/to/your/input/audio.wav --model_filename UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx
```

This command will download the specified model file, process the `audio.wav` input audio and generate two new files in the current directory, one containing vocals and one containing instrumental.

**Note:** You do not need to download any files yourself - audio-separator does that automatically for you!

To see a list of supported models, run `audio-separator --list_models`

Any file listed in the list models output can be specified (with file extension) with the model_filename parameter (e.g. `--model_filename UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx`) and it will be automatically downloaded to the `--model_file_dir` (default: `/tmp/audio-separator-models/`) folder on first usage.

### As a Dependency in a Python Project

You can use Audio Separator in your own Python project. Here's how you can use it:

```
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator class (with optional configuration properties below)
separator = Separator()

# Load a machine learning model (if unspecified, defaults to 'UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx')
separator.load_model()

# Perform the separation on specific audio files without reloading the model
output_files = separator.separate('audio1.wav')

print(f"Separation complete! Output file(s): {' '.join(output_files)}")
```

#### Batch processing, or processing with multiple models

You can process multiple separations without reloading the model, to save time and memory.

You only need to load a model when choosing or changing models. See example below:

```
from audio_separator.separator import Separator

# Initialize the Separator with other configuration properties below
separator = Separator()

# Load a model
separator.load_model(model_filename='UVR-MDX-NET-Inst_HQ_3.onnx')

# Separate multiple audio files without reloading the model
output_file_paths_1 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_2 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_3 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')

# Load a different model
separator.load_model(model_filename='UVR_MDXNET_KARA_2.onnx')

# Separate the same files with the new model
output_file_paths_4 = separator.separate('audio1.wav')
output_file_paths_5 = separator.separate('audio2.wav')
output_file_paths_6 = separator.separate('audio3.wav')
```

## Requirements 📋

Python >= 3.9

Libraries: torch, onnx, onnxruntime, numpy, librosa, requests, six, tqdm, pydub

## Developing Locally

This project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging. Follow these steps to setup a local development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your machine.
- Install Conda (I recommend Miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to manage your Python virtual environments

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audio-separator.git
cd audio-separator
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username if you've forked the repository, or use the main repository URL if you have the permissions.

### Create and activate the Conda Environment

To create and activate the conda environment, use the following commands:

```
conda env create
conda activate audio-separator-dev
```

### Install Dependencies

Once you're inside the conda env, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
poetry install
```


### Running the Command-Line Interface Locally

You can run the CLI command directly within the virtual environment. For example:

```
audio-separator path/to/your/audio-file.wav
```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

Once you are done with your development work, you can exit the virtual environment by simply typing:

```
conda deactivate
```

### Building the Package

To build the package for distribution, use the following command:

```
poetry build
```

This will generate the distribution packages in the dist directory - but for now only @beveradb will be able to publish to PyPI.

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are very much welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes, and I'll try to review, merge and publish promptly!

- This project is 100% open-source and free for anyone to use and modify as they wish. 
- If the maintenance workload for this repo somehow becomes too much for me I'll ask for volunteers to share maintainership of the repo, though I don't think that is very likely
- Development and support for the MDX-Net separation models is part of the main [UVR project](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui), this repo is just a CLI/Python package wrapper to simplify running those models programmatically. So, if you want to try and improve the actual models, please get involved in the UVR project and look for guidance there!
