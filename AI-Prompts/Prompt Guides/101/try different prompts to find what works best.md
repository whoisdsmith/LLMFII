## Try different prompts to find what works best

We could go on with more tips and tricks on how to engineer prompts but the best way to get you going is to try variations of the same basic prompt to see what works best. For example:

1. When attempting few-shot learning, try also including direct instructions
2. Rephrase a direct instruction set to be more or less concise (e.g. taking our previous example of just saying “Translate.” and expanding on the instruction to say “Translate from English to Spanish.”
3. Try different persona keywords to see how it affects the response style
4. Use fewer or more examples in your few-shot learning

At the end of the day, prompt engineering is about finding the right combination of instructions, examples, and formatting to get the best and most consistent responses from an LLM. Make good use of the Playground to find the right prompt structure for you, and then try it out with plenty of examples with tools like [Humanloop](https://humanloop.com/) to see how it performs on real world data.
