## Useful verbs

Instruct verbs are the first word in the prompt. They are used to instruct the model to do something. They are the most important part of the prompt. We may argue that they act as magic words that make a successful prompt, it helps to make the machine understand and follow your instructions. Each of these verbs has a specific meaning that can help the model understand what kind of answer is expected. For example, if you ask the model to explain something, it will provide a detailed explanation. On the other hand, if you ask the model to summarize something, it will provide a brief overview.
