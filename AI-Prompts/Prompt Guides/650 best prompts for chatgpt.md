*I made this image – Best prompts for ChatGPT*

I thought we would start with the best ChatGPT prompts.

These are prompts I have used, tested, and absolutely believe are game-changers.

**First, I’ll list the plain prompts (the patterns you can copy), then I’ll follow up with tons of examples so that you truly understand their potential.**

Keep in mind that prompts can be commands, questions, statements, and even topics.

The best ChatGPT Prompts:

-   Act like an expert in X
-   Present the information in a table

-   Only explain X
-   You are a X
-   For this target audience
-   Write a long explanation
-   Create a list of XYZ
-   Produce a detailed plan for XYZ
-   Give me step-by-step instructions to XYZ

These are my favorites because they are so versatile and apply to almost any topic.

You can ask ChatGPT to act like an expert in anything (gardening, pets, SEO, relationships, etc). Additionally, you can ask it to be a translator, interviewer, travel guide, motivational coach, or chef.

You can target any audience (18-24-year-old single dads, new moms, book lovers, etc).

## **5 Easy Ways To Write Better ChatGPT Prompts**

Here are 10 quick tips to write better prompts for ChatGPT:

1.  **Customize your prompt**
2.  **Feed ChatGPT your facts and information**
3.  **Ask follow-up questions**
4.  **Be as specific as possible**
5.  **Write a long prompt paragraph**

Think of your prompts as paragraphs, not sentences.

For example:

> You are a blog writer with years of experience. Write a long and detailed blog post for bloggers who are learning how to write SEO-optimized blog posts. Create a catchy introduction, followed by these subsections (What Is an SEO-optimized Blog Post? How To Write an SEO-optimized blog post, and Avoid These Common Mistakes When Writing SEO Blog Posts). Finish with a short conclusion that includes a Call-to-Action to read other blog posts on my website.

**Combine prompts in this guide with specific data and limitations. Guide ChatGPT like you would an employee. Tell it what to do and what not to do as precisely as you can.**
