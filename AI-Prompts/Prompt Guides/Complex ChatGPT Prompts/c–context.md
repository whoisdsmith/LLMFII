## C–Context

In the CHAT method, “Context” (C) refers to the situation or background information relevant to the task. It provides a framework for the user to understand what the task is about and what the ChatGPT model is expected to do. The context sets the stage for the information that the ChatGPT model is going to provide.

For instance, if the purpose is to offer information about a historical event, the context might contain the occasion’s date and place, the main participants, and any additional pertinent background details that aid in setting the scene. The user can better understand and retain the information by understanding the context in which it is being presented thanks to the context.
