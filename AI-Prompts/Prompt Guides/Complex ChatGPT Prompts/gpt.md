## GPT

ChatGPT has a tenendcy to mix up facts, self referrer and give false answers, to avoid this, itâ€™s recommended to add some lines about not making false statements, or ChatGPT referrering to itself. However, this is not a guarantee that every fact is true, so always remember to fact check ChatGPTs response.
