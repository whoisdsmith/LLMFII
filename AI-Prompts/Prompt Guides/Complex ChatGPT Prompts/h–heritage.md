## H–Heritage

In the CHAT method, “Heritage” (H) refers to the knowledge and skills that the ChatGPT model possesses. This component outlines the model’s relevant expertise and helps the user understand what the model is capable of.

For example, if the task is to provide information about a particular scientific field, the heritage component would describe the ChatGPT model’s knowledge of that field. This could include information about the model’s training data, its specialized knowledge, or any other relevant qualifications or skills. The heritage element aids in building confidence between the user and the model by enabling the user to comprehend the amount of knowledge the model brings to the task.
