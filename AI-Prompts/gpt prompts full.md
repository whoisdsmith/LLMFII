> As a licensed mental health counselor, what are methods within the theory that are to be applied during the helping process? How do people change in this theory?  
> How do relationships fit into this theory? These relationships include family members, friends, and the therapist.

Please write an abstract that is one paragraph and is at least 170 words in length. Include a list of at least 4 keywords at the end
