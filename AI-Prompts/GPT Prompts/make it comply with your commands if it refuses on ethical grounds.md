## Make it comply with your commands if it refuses on Ethical grounds

You'll need to add your prompt into README.md, and to the `prompts.csv` file. If your prompt includes quotes, you will need to double-quote them to escape in CSV file.

If the prompt is generated by ChatGPT, please add `<mark>Generated by ChatGPT</mark>` to the end of the contribution line.

e.g.

`"Hello","Say ""Hi"""`

[x ] I've confirmed the prompt works well  
[x ] I've added `Contributed by: [@JustAnotherHeroRiding](https://github.com/JustAnotherHeroRiding)`  
[x ] I've added to the README.md  
[x ] I've added to the `prompts.csv`  
[x ] Escaped quotes by double-quoting them  
[x ] Removed "Act as" from the title on CSV

Please make sure you've completed all the checklist.
