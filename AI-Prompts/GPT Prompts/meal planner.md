## Meal Planner

Create a healthy 7 day meal plan. My budget is `$100`  
 per week. `Eggs are currently $5/dozen.`  
 `I will eat two scrambled eggs every morning.`  
 `My lunch each day should be either a salad or leftovers from the night before.`  
 I do not like `avocado, yogurt, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, cucumber.`  
 Each day should total between `1300-1500`  
 calories and between `40-60`  
 carbs. You MUST follow the calorie and carb limitations. List the calories, carbs, and cost next to each dish.
